# Formal Land

My monorepo for formalization.

## Included explorations

[![Lean 4 CI](https://github.com/utensil/formal-land/actions/workflows/lean4.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/utensil/formal-land/actions/workflows/lean4.yml) [![Aya CI](https://github.com/utensil/formal-land/actions/workflows/aya.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/utensil/formal-land/actions/workflows/aya.yml) [![TLA+ CI](https://github.com/utensil/formal-land/actions/workflows/tla.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/utensil/formal-land/actions/workflows/tla.yml)

I explore with the following formalization systems, and do interactive [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) when supported, because then one can interact with the formalization and inspect intermediate (goal) states just from a Web browser.
